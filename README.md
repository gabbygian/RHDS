I have not much of a clue what im doing, and if you want to also not have much of a clue, read these instructions:

Code in R for about 2-3 days with no prior experience
Decide to do the RHDS course with that experience
Realise you are dumb and will have to LOCK IN to catch up as you have NEVER used VS studio and couldnt create a data frame in R without help.
Repent

Slumber




Adios...
